            The HTTP q parameter was either missing or had no value.
            For geocoding requests, this means that an empty address was specified as input. For directions requests, this means that no query was specified in the input.

            <summary>
            The GDirections object could not compute directions between the points mentioned in the query.
            This is usually because there is no route available between the two points, or because we do not have data for routing in that region.

            The given key has gone over the requests limit in the 24 hour period or has submitted too many requests in too short a period of time.
            If you're sending multiple requests in parallel or in a tight loop, use a timer or pause in your code to make sure you don't send the requests too quickly.
